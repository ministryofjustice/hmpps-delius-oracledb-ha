# During AWS Start/Stop we occassionally have disconnections about around 60-70 seconds during DB re-start.
# 120 seconds provides sufficent overhead for these to automatically resolve and prevent false failover.
# This may be overwritten on an environment basis - set it in the primary_db.yml file (does not need to be set for standby databases)
